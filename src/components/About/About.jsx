                <p>I'm an architect and designer driven by a passion for creating meaningful spaces that blend aesthetics with functionality. With a deep curiosity for cultures and environments, I often draw inspiration from my travels to inform my creative work.</p>
                <p className='mt-4'>Whether it's urban planning, interior design, or conceptual architecture, I believe every project tells a story. My approach is collaborative, intentional, and rooted in thoughtful design. Ready to start your next project?</p>
